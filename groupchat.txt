•	CH/A: In A Pocket Style Manual (PSM) read pp.110-119, paying particular attention to the examples of acceptable/unacceptable summary and paraphrase. Be sure to bring the book to class.

9/6/17, 12:11:50 PM: Michael Kolber: English we went over the homework and discussed. Group A did MLA and plagiarism. Group B is doing it tomorrow. Complit we covered epithets in the text, the concept of Xenia which is like the obligation of hospitality, Homeric honor which is not just words of praise but also physical trophies like slaves gold tapestries etc., and that society is governed by an honor code consisting of glory and death with the acceptance of the fact that you might be the one to die. More or less.

9/6/17, 6:51:50 PM: ‪+1 (646) 595‑6231‬: What should we do after reading "on trnaslation" just summarize? Cuz theres usually questions
9/6/17, 7:32:15 PM: Michael Kolber: mmarize the main points from the various readings on translation (Barnet, Cunningham, Meyer, Coetzee, Pinsky, Jackson). How do they differ from each other? How do they overlap?

Just this I think
9/6/17, 7:38:56 PM: Michael Kolber: Any thoughts on making a joint group for all of FHP? We only share Miceli so I don't fully see the point, but maybe someone else has other ideas?
9/6/17, 8:18:31 PM: Skyler Montoya: Hmm maybe
9/6/17, 8:19:05 PM: Skyler Montoya: So should we write about each reading separately? Or just combine them?
9/6/17, 8:20:06 PM: ‪+1 (347) 356‑7000‬: I think we're supposed to combine them but im not yet entirely sure how
9/6/17, 8:20:38 PM: Skyler Montoya: Ugh this is frustrating lol
9/6/17, 8:21:16 PM: ‪+1 (347) 356‑7000‬: 🙌 Preach it

9/6/17, 8:57:24 PM: ‪+1 (516) 840‑1623‬: I'll figure it out
9/6/17, 8:58:00 PM: Skyler Montoya: Lol just explain each reading separately and then say what they have in common in the end
9/6/17, 8:58:38 PM: ‪+1 (516) 286‑5712‬: thank you skyler!!
9/6/17, 8:59:03 PM: Skyler Montoya: Np 😊

9/6/17, 11:32:56 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: WHY DOES THIS HELP US IN LIFE???
9/6/17, 11:33:06 PM: ‪+1 (516) 840‑1623‬: I think we are done with translation after this

9/7/17, 12:14:36 AM: Michael Kolber: That's why I wrote four sentences tops for each main point. That was about 425 words which is a bit more than half an essay. I think she's looking for quality over quantity

9/10/17, 7:48:46 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: I though we had to read book 1.
9/10/17, 7:49:06 PM: Kale Weinstein: Book one is for tomorrow
9/10/17, 7:49:18 PM: Kale Weinstein: The rest for Wednesday
9/10/17, 7:49:23 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: Ah
9/10/17, 7:49:37 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: So what does 413a and 518b even mean?
9/10/17, 7:49:45 PM: Kale Weinstein: I think... unless someone will correct me!
9/10/17, 7:50:12 PM: Kale Weinstein: They are sections in part 3 and 4- look at the margins
9/10/17, 7:51:04 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: K
9/10/17, 7:51:09 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: Thanks
9/10/17, 8:34:56 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: Wait, do we have to read 413a *to* 518b, or 413a *and* 518b?
9/10/17, 8:36:19 PM: ‪+1 (347) 356‑7000‬: To
9/10/17, 8:36:27 PM: ‪+1 (347) 356‑7000‬: Its a whole section
9/10/17, 8:37:32 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: How come in my book it says that 518b is in book 7? I thought you guys said it's all in books 3-4?
9/10/17, 8:38:22 PM: ‪+1 (347) 356‑7000‬: Same here
9/10/17, 8:38:51 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: And it skips books 5 and 8 so I
9/10/17, 8:39:04 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: *I'm just so lost
9/10/17, 8:39:19 PM: ‪+1 (347) 356‑7000‬: We can just clarify it tomorrow if needed
9/10/17, 8:42:56 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: But 518 is in book 7
9/10/17, 8:43:36 PM: ‪+1 (646) 595‑6231‬: Ya but wouldn't make sense that we would skip to there
9/10/17, 8:44:05 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: We
9/10/17, 8:44:10 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: UGH
9/10/17, 8:44:25 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: We're probably supposed to read all of it then.
9/10/17, 8:44:36 PM: Michael Kolber: You're right 😁 I'm bad at reading Roman numerals.
9/10/17, 8:45:20 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: So just to clarify then, when you said it was in 3 and 4, it's actually in books 3-7?
9/10/17, 8:46:09 PM: Michael Kolber: Yeah, except for 5, which appears to not exist
9/10/17, 8:46:11 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: In the textbook, Book 3 starts with 412
9/10/17, 8:47:08 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: So the point is, we read whatever the textbook has, from 413a, to 518b?
9/10/17, 8:47:10 PM: Michael Kolber: If you look you'll see the numbers skip from 445 to 503
9/10/17, 8:47:19 PM: Michael Kolber: Yeah
9/10/17, 8:47:30 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: Great
9/10/17, 8:47:47 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: Did he specify the exact page numbers in the textbook?
9/10/17, 8:48:00 PM: Michael Kolber: 79-105
9/10/17, 8:48:29 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: Well that's the pages those are on, so this all makes perfect sense.
9/10/17, 8:49:04 PM: ‪+1 (917) 444‑0516‬: R u being sarcastic?
9/10/17, 8:49:12 PM: ‪+1 (646) 595‑6231‬: Lol

9/10/17, 8:52:36 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: What Michael said
9/10/17, 8:53:04 PM: Michael Kolber: And if you're doing paragraph numbers skip book 5 which is 446-502
9/10/17, 8:53:30 PM: Skyler Montoya: Wait so is this on SparkNotes or no?
9/10/17, 8:53:42 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: And in the future, don't take sparknotes' word for it. 😂
9/10/17, 8:54:05 PM: Michael Kolber: I emailed him on Friday. He has yet to get back to me...
9/10/17, 8:54:25 PM: ‪+1 (917) 444‑0516‬: What did u ask him

9/10/17, 8:55:37 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: You can read the sparknotes that covers paragraphs 413-445 and 503-518. Don't pay attention to the book numbers, cuz sparknotes got them wrong.
9/10/17, 8:56:10 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: So just read the sparknotes on those lines
9/10/17, 8:56:17 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: *paragraphs

9/10/17, 9:06:15 PM: Skyler Montoya: Yeah what he says is basically what is in the book
9/11/17, 7:17:02 PM: Shoshana Snow: Does the passage we pick from the Odyssey have to be more poetic?
9/11/17, 7:18:35 PM: ‪+1 (347) 356‑7000‬: In the instructions the only req that she wrote was the quote had to be from any chapter other than 1-4. Im guessing its up to you how poetic you want it to be
9/11/17, 8:53:33 PM: ‪+1 (516) 286‑5712‬: how long are your outlines for english???

9/11/17, 9:46:08 PM: Michael Kolber: She said bullet points are okay
9/11/17, 9:46:08 PM: Kale Weinstein: I would think it fine for an outline
9/11/17, 9:46:09 PM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: She said that's ok
9/11/17, 9:46:33 PM: ‪+1 (646) 595‑6231‬: Thanks!

9/13/17, 10:05:58 PM: Skyler Montoya: I would but I'm still working on this damn English 😢
9/13/17, 10:16:06 PM: Shoshana Snow: If we quote part of our passage do we need to put an in text citation?
9/13/17, 10:16:18 PM: Shoshana Snow: Like in middle of our paragraph?
9/13/17, 10:16:42 PM: Kale Weinstein: The sample didn't.. but I had the same question
9/13/17, 10:16:59 PM: Michael Kolber: The sample didn't but the instructions say we should
9/13/17, 10:17:10 PM: Michael Kolber: Just do it just in case, it's only a few extra words
9/13/17, 10:17:13 PM: Shoshana Snow: That's why I'm confused now
9/13/17, 10:17:21 PM: Shoshana Snow: Ugh I already sent mine to her
9/13/17, 10:17:24 PM: Michael Kolber: MLA says to, she said follow MLA

9/13/17, 10:37:16 PM: ‪+1 (347) 356‑7000‬: Exactly the way were supposed to do it
9/13/17, 10:37:36 PM: Kale Weinstein: That's out of text citing I think
9/13/17, 10:38:04 PM: ‪+1 (347) 356‑7000‬: Ohh and no since its a poem just the number line. At least i think thats what it said innthe guide
9/13/17, 11:15:55 PM: Michael Kolber: And book number
9/13/17, 11:16:24 PM: Michael Kolber: Basically "this is a quote blah blah blah" (5.342).

Then at the end just cite the book
9/13/17, 11:17:38 PM: Skyler Montoya: Do we need to write a whole page for both bullet point questions?
9/13/17, 11:17:47 PM: ‪+1 (646) 595‑6231‬: Thanks

9/14/17, 9:08:02 AM: ‪+1 (347) 949‑2455‬: for both altman and teik
9/14/17, 9:08:14 AM: ‪+1 (347) 949‑2455‬: should i make a works cited page idk
9/14/17, 9:08:15 AM: ‪+1 (646) 595‑6231‬: Just add it on the bottom she gives it to you
9/14/17, 9:08:30 AM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: Well for Teik it should all be from the odyssey and you're good.
9/14/17, 9:08:37 AM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: I didn't write a works cited.
9/14/17, 9:08:50 AM: ‪+1 (347) 949‑2455‬: 👍
9/14/17, 9:09:12 AM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: We needed a works cited on the thing due for Altman today??,
9/14/17, 9:09:31 AM: ‪+1 (347) 949‑2455‬: i mean i cited the sources so i assumed i needed one
9/14/17, 9:09:38 AM: ‪+1 (347) 949‑2455‬: if you dont cite I'm going to assume you don't need one
9/14/17, 9:09:53 AM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: Yeah but
9/14/17, 9:10:05 AM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: She literally gave us the sources
9/14/17, 9:10:32 AM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: And we were answering questions based off exact sources.
9/14/17, 9:10:55 AM: Shoshana Snow: I don't think you need to cite Altman's hw
9/14/17, 9:10:56 AM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: So why would we need to tell her what sources we used?
9/14/17, 9:11:07 AM: ‪+1 (347) 949‑2455‬: I guess so
9/14/17, 9:11:29 AM: ‪+1 (917) 600‑9505‬: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
9/14/17, 9:11:37 AM: ‪+1 (718) 552‑5535‬: I didnt even do it yet 🙃
9/14/17, 9:11:48 AM: ‪+1 (347) 356‑7000‬: Altman said not to stick with the whole mla format for homeworks only for essays and things of that sort
