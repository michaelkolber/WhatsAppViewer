# WhatsApp Chat Export Viewer

#### "WhatApp Viewer" for short.

## [Try it here.](https://michaelkolber.github.io/whatsapp-viewer/)

WhatsApp Viewer takes those ugly, unformatted WhatsApp chat exports and puts them into a nice, easy-to-read format similar in appearance to the WhatsApp GUI.

WhatsApp Viewer uses Python on AWS Lambda, JavaScript client-side, and HTML/CSS for the web-based GUI.
